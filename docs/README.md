# Hidden Folders Access

Make Obsidian index hidden root-level folders (names starting with a dot, e.g. `.claude`, `.github`) so they show up in the file explorer, the metadata cache, the link graph, and Bases — while keeping the folders hidden on disk so external tools (Claude Code, git, etc.) keep working unchanged.

## Key Features

- Per-folder opt-in: pick exactly which hidden root folders Obsidian should index.
- Full Obsidian integration: hidden files appear in the file explorer, graph view, search, metadata cache, and Bases.
- Live updates: creating, modifying, renaming, or deleting files inside an enabled folder updates Obsidian in real time.
- No on-disk changes: names keep their leading dot, no symlinks, no copies.
- Clean disable: turning a folder off immediately removes its entries from Obsidian.

## Installation

### Community plugins (recommended)

1. In Obsidian, go to **Settings → Community plugins**.
2. Disable **Restricted mode** if it's enabled.
3. Select **Browse**, search for **Hidden Folders Access**, install it, then enable it.

You can also browse the catalog on the [Obsidian Community](https://community.obsidian.md/) website.

### Manual installation

If the plugin isn't listed in the community catalog yet (or you want a specific version):

1. Download `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` from the [latest release](https://github.com/dsebastien/obsidian-hidden-folders-access/releases).
2. Copy them into `<Vault>/.obsidian/plugins/hidden-folders-access/`.
3. Reload Obsidian and enable **Hidden Folders Access** in **Settings → Community plugins**.

### BRAT (bleeding edge)

[BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) (Beta Reviewers Auto-update Tool) installs plugins straight from a GitHub repo and keeps them updated automatically. Use this if you want the latest commits — **things might break**.

1. Install **Obsidian42 - BRAT** from **Settings → Community plugins → Browse** and enable it.
2. Run **BRAT: Add a beta plugin for testing** from the command palette.
3. Paste `https://github.com/dsebastien/obsidian-hidden-folders-access`.
4. Select the latest version and confirm.
5. Enable **Hidden Folders Access** in **Settings → Community plugins**.

## Quick Start

1. Install and enable the plugin (see above).
2. Open **Settings → Hidden Folders Access**.
3. Toggle on the folders you want Obsidian to index.
4. The files appear in the explorer and become usable from Bases, Dataview, search, etc.

## When to Use It

- You keep AI agent configuration in `.claude/` and want to browse / query it from Obsidian Bases.
- You want to include `.github/`, `.obsidian-templates/`, or other hidden folders in the vault without renaming them.
- You already manage dotted folders with external tools and don't want Obsidian to rename or duplicate them.
